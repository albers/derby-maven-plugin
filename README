If you're in the kind of situation where you're using Maven and have to start and stop a Derby database through your tests, then look no further!

This is a simple Maven plugin to start/stop a Derby database during a Maven build.

The produced database is stored to the underlying file system and is available for inspection after the tests have finished executing.
